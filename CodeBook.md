#Code Book

This code book includes information about the source data, the transformations performed after collecting the data and some information about the variables of the resulting data sets.

#Feature Selection

The features selected for this data frame came from the transformation of the data in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0", which in turn have been taken from experiments carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz data were captured, of accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ tGravityAcc-XYZ tBodyAccJerk-XYZ tBodyGyro-XYZ tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ tBodyAccMag tGravityAccMag tBodyAccJerkMag tBodyGyroMag tBodyGyroJerkMag fBodyAcc-XYZ fBodyAccJerk-XYZ fBodyGyro-XYZ fBodyAccMag fBodyAccJerkMag fBodyGyroMag fBodyGyroJerkMag

angle(): Angle between two vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean tBodyAccMean tBodyAccJerkMean tBodyGyroMean tBodyGyroJerkMean

#Feature Vector variables:

mean() : mean values of multiple measurements of the original variables. Type: Real number

std(): Standard deviation of multiple measurements of the original variables. Type: Real number

activity_id: Identifier, identifying the activity of each subject Type: Integer Values: 1 : 6

activity_name: Descriptive name of each subject's activity Type: Factor Values: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

subject_id : Identifier, identifying each subject Type: Integer Values: 1 : 30

#Activity Labels

WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test
